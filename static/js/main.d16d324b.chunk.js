In recent decades, the rise of viral Internet culture has led to the development of a new global economy: the online "meme economy". Drawing from scarce resources (such as creativity, humor, and time), individual producers (meme makers) offer their goods (memes in the form of multimodal ideas) over a centralized marketplace (Internet forums such as subreddits on Reddit) in exchange for currency (Internet points such as Upvotes or Likes). Oftentimes, knowing ',Object(n.jsx)("em",{children:"where"}),' to post a meme can greatly affect how well it is received by the Internet community. Posting in a highly apt channel can lead to instant Internet fame, while posting in a suboptimal channel can lead to one\'s creative work failing to gain attention, or worse, being stolen and reposted by meme thieves. Additionally, posting the same content in several different channels can be considered "spamming" and is negatively regarded.

To extract features from multimodal data, we leverage multimodal deep learning, in which we use multiple feature extractor networks to learn the separate modes individually, and an aggregator network to combine the features to produce the final output classification. We scrape Reddit meme subreddits for post data, including: subreddit name, upvote/downvote count, images, meme text via OCR (or human OCR), and post titles.

Based on our personal understanding of the Internet meme culture, we decided that a larger dataset needed to be collected in order to reasonably represent the various subcultures on the Internet. Accordingly, we scraped meme data from Reddit, a popular hub for sharing meme content, which totals 70,000+ examples. Additionally, instead of a binary classification problem, we defined a multi-class classification problem in which our model has to output the most apt Reddit subreddit that a given meme fits. The rationale behind this decision was that different communities on the Internet operate by different de facto rules and guidelines. It is difficult to prescribe a blanket hateful/un-hateful categorization for all memes shared on the Internet. From a human perspective, a meme is usually considered within a given context. For example, particularly dark or edgy jokes may be perfectly acceptable in a community such as r/dankmemes but unacceptable according to Facebook\u2019s platform guidelines. Hence, our work on multimodal multi-class classification could serve as a first step into exploring the effect that the style of multimodal content has on whether or not it is considered hateful. Furthermore, our model can be used by meme creators in deciding where to best post their meme.

We included 19 different subreddits, which represents a good variety of multimodal content that people enjoy sharing on the Internet. Importantly, while some subreddits are stylistically very distinct from each other yet feature similar post title conventions (dankmemes vs. tumblr), others are more difficult to distinguish from each other just by looking at the image, even for humans (meirl vs. 2meirl4meirl).

For this approach, we scanned the 7000 titles of the posts, and for each word that appeared more than 30 times, it was assigned a number. There were 2420 words which were considered part of our vocab in the post titles, so each title was converted to a 1 by 2420 vector, where the index \u201ci\u201d in the vector was set to 1 if the word assigned the number \u201ci\u201d appeared in the title. This vector was used as an input to a linear network, with the first layer having 2420 input neurons and 512 output neurons, while the second layer had 512 input neurons and 20 output neurons because there were 20 output classes to predict.

Using the built-in tokenizer in the package, we separated each post title to 20 words (either truncating if there were more or padding with \u201c[PAD]\u201d) then used this as input into the model, which output a 1x20x768 tensor for 1 sample. Besides this we chose not to do any other significant preprocessing to the post titles that would normally be done in other language models, like lemmatizing or removing special characters as the post titles may rely on these features for meaning (eg emojis and utf-8 characters for Subs like r/surrealmemes). We then fed this output into a few fully-connected layers with ReLU activation before the prediction layer. However, due to computational limitations we added a convolutional layer after the output of BERT to downsize the number of weights needed in the fully-connected layers.

This design decision made it much easier to load in the dataset, since many of our examples are very large (on the order of 100M pixels) and transfer learning requires less data. However, we still sample from the full dataset. Specifically, the data was split into a training set and a validation set, with 200 examples in the training set for each category, and 100 examples in the validation set for each category. We chose to fine-tune the convnet on the meme data instead of freezing the pretrained weights as a fixed feature extractor. This decision was supported by our exploratory experimentation in which we found that a pretrained ResNet-18 model, when fine-tuned on meme images, achieved 0.015 higher accuracy when compared to when the weights were frozen. This finding makes sense because meme formats are typically not represented in the ImageNet dataset, so some domain shift is necessary. Also informed by our exploratory experimentation, we apply data augmentation in the form of random crops and horizontal flips. The most impactful hyperparameters we found were learning rate and momentum, which we set to 0.001 and 0.9, respectively.
